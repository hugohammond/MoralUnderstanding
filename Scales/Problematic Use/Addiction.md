**Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale (SABAS)**
<br />
*Prompt: Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statements below in
relation to your smartphone use habits.*<br />
<br />
My smartphone is the most important thing in my life.<br />
Conflicts have arisen between me and my family (or friends) because of my smartphone use.<br />
Preoccupying myself with my smartphone is a way of changing my mood (I get a buzz, or I can escape or get away, if I need to).<br />
Over time, I fiddle around more and more with my smartphone.<br />
If I cannot use or access my smartphone when I feel like, I feel sad, moody, or irritable.<br />
If I try to cut the time I use my smartphone, I manage to do so for a while, but then I end up using it as much or more than before.<br />
