**Television Uses and Graitifcations**

COMPANIONSHIP <br />
1. So I won't have to be alone <br />
2. When there's no one else to talk to or be with <br />
3. Because it makes me feel less lonely <br />

HABIT/ PASS TIME <br />
1. Just because it's there <br />
2. Because it's a habit, just something I do <br />
3. When I have nothing better to do <br />
4. Because it passes the time away, particularly when I'm bored <br />
5. Because it gives me something to do to occupy my time <br />

ENTERTAINMENT <br />
1. Because it entertains me  <br />
2. Because it's enjoyable <br />
3. Because it amuses me <br />

INFORMATION <br />
1. Because it helps me learn things about myself and others <br />
2. So I can learn how to do things which I haven't done before <br />
3. So I could learn about what could happen to me <br />
4. So I can talk with other people about what's on <br />

ESCAPE <br />
1. So 1 can forget about school or other things <br />
2. So 1 can get away from the rest of the family or others <br />
3. So 1 can get away from what I'm doing <br />
