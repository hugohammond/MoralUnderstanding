# Identification
## Cohen, 2004
 <br />
 
While viewing program X, I felt as if I was part of the action. <br />
While viewing program X, I forgot myself and was fully absorbed. <br />
I was able to understand the events in the program in a manner similar to that in which character X understood them. <br />
I think I have a good understanding of character X. <br />
I tend to understand the reasons why character X does what he or she does. <br />
While viewing the show I could feel the emotions character X portrayed. <br />
During viewing, I felt I could really get inside character Xâ€™s head. <br />
At key moments in the show, I felt I knew exactly what character X was going through. <br />
While viewing the program, I wanted character X to succeed in achieving his or her goals. <br />
When character X succeeded I felt joy, but when he or she failed, I was sad. <br />
