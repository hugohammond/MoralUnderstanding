Here are the PEBL files for BART tests which were used in Meshi, D., Ulusoy, E., Ã–zdem-Mertens, C., Grady, S. M., Freestone, D. M., Eden, A., & Ellithorpe, M. E. (2020). Problematic social media use is associated with increased risk-aversion after negative outcomes in the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. _Psychology of Addictive Behaviors_, 34(4), 549. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/adb0000558 <br />

In the paper, there were three different BART tests:
  1) Normal BART (30 - 30 - 30 ratio)
  2) Single-colored BART (30 Blue)
  3) Two-colored BART (30 Blue - 30 Orange (order is randomized))
